This project directory contains two directories for some scripts written in Javascript for the Bitwig controller API. 

The Akai directory contains a script for the Akai LPK25 MIDI keyboard controller. The script is very basic, only sending MIDI note events. Please feel free to expand or revise it !

The Generic directory includes two scripts, one for the MidiSport 2x2 hardware MIDI interface and one for the ALSA virtual MIDI device.

The MidiSport script is also very basic. It exposes the device's ports to Bitwig with their names, so connection is straightforward.

The ALSA virtual MIDI script is used in conjunction with ALSA's snd-virmidi module and Bitwig's Hardware Instrument router device. 

If the virtual MIDI device is not already loaded, install it with this command (as root user) :

	modprobe snd-virmidi midi_devs=1

This will create a single virtual MIDI port with 16 channels.

Bitwig's Hardware Instrument router's output list will display sixteen blank entries. Select the first blank entry and set the router's Audio Input device to Stereo.

Use your MIDI connections software to route the VirMidi port to your favorite synthesizer/sampler/processor/host/whatever. Be sure to connect the target's audio output to a valid audio input port, i.e. Bitwig, your system audio, or any other available port. 

Notes:

For some reason the a2jmidi daemon is incompatible with the VirMidi script. Use JACK's raw or seq MIDI driver options if you need a JackMIDI connection.

This script has been rendered somewhat redundant thanks to falkTX's Jackass VST plugin. I advise using the my script only if the plugin doesn't work for your purposes.
